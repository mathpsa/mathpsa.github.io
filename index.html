We Survey 19 freshman, softmore and juniors. Around 42% of the students that we surveyed are currently failing their current Math class. Most students think their teacher can improve by focusing on the steps to solving a problem instead of giving a solution. Many other students also feel that the class is going to fast and they don't have time to understand all the material. For students, they can improve their involvment in class. They should also spend more time studing at home. Teacher and parents should actively reach out to each other to make sure their students is on track.
<br>
Other students also think teacher need to change their ways of teaching. Here is a direct quote from a current Math 3 student.
                    
"Teachers should change their ways of teaching, For example my teacher openes up the big ideas book and asigns an assignment and prays we get it.
                    This year he also set us up to fail, he was apsent for the first 3 weeks. When he came back he want so fast, so fast Where if you were apsent, you were in deep trouble. 
                    
I feel like math teahcers could be more connected with the studnts. I feel like some of them forget that we have an outside life."
